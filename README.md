# MEDYANSimRunner.jl
Manage long running MEDYAN.jl simulations

Simulations run using code stored in the `input` directory and write outputs to `output` directory.

## `input` directory

The input directory must contain a `main.jl` file, a `Manifest.toml`, a `Project.toml`, and a `Job.toml`.

The input directory will be the working directory of the simulation and can include other data needed for the simulation, including an `Artifacts.toml`

The input directory should not be mutated during or after a simulation.

### `main.jl` file

This file contains the julia functions used when running the simulation.

### `Manifest.toml` and `Project.toml`

These contain the julia environment used when running the simulation.

### `Job.toml`

This file contains options for configuring the simulation runner.


## `output` directory

The output directory has an `out$N` subdirectory for parallel job N's output.

Each out subdirectory has the following files.

### `logs.txt`
Any logs, warnings, and errors generated by the simulation are saved in this file.

### `header.json`
A description of the system.

### `info.txt`
Data describing the saved snapshots, and if the simulation is done or errored, or needs to be continued.

### `snapshots` subdirectory
Contains `snapshot$i.h5` files where `i` is the step of the simulation.
